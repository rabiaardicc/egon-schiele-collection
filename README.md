# Egon Schiele: Expression, Eroticism, and the Divided Self

This project presents a structured data collection of ten selected artworks by Austrian expressionist artist Egon Schiele (1890–1918).  
The collection focuses on recurring themes in Schiele’s work such as eroticism, emotional vulnerability, bodily fragmentation, and psychological intensity.

The artworks are represented in JSON format, including metadata fields such as:
- Title
- Year
- Medium
- Dimensions
- Description
- Notes

The goal of this project is to explore how cultural and visual artifacts can be restructured into data models — without losing their thematic complexity — as part of a digital humanities approach.

> This mini project was created as part of the LV 14143 course assignment on representing artifacts through data.
